# Copilot + GitHub Practical Persistent Memory System (copilot-github-ppms)

A modular system for persistent LLM memory across multiple projects, using GitHub as the backend for context, instructions, lessons, guardrails, code library, research, and backlog.

## Structure

- **Global Knowledge Base:**  
  - Lessons, guardrails, research, backlog, code library, instruction templates â€” all accessible and referenced across projects.
- **Project-Specific Folders:**  
  - Each project has its own folder for transcripts and handoff instructions.
- **Index:**  
  - Root-level index.md tracks all projects and global assets.

See each folder's README or protocol for guidance!
