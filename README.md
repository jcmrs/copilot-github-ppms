# Copilot + GitHub Practical Persistent Memory System (copilot-github-ppms)

## Functional Description

**copilot-github-ppms** is a modular, extensible framework for enabling persistent memory in Copilot and LLM-driven workflows, using GitHub as the backend for all context, transcripts, instructions, lessons, and behavioral guardrails.

**Key Functions:**
- **Session Handoff:** Store and restore full conversation transcripts and project context, ensuring continuity across Copilot/LLM sessions.
- **Instructions & Bootstraps:** Provide editable, versioned instructions and templates for initializing new conversations or workflows.
- **Lessons & Guardrails:** Track lessons learned and encode behavioral boundaries as reusable, referenceable files.
- **Code Library:** Maintain a library of implementation snippets, scripts, and templates for rapid prototyping or reuse.
- **Research & Backlog:** Log research findings, competitor analysis, and backlog of features or ideas for future development.
- **Modularity & Extensibility:** Designed for easy expansionâ€”add new modules, features, or workflows as needed.

**Workflow:**
1. User or Copilot saves and updates the key files (transcripts, instructions, lessons, guardrails) to the repo.
2. For a new or continued session, Copilot/LLM reads these files to restore context and operate within defined boundaries.
3. All changes are versioned and tracked via GitHub, enabling reliable, transparent, and collaborative persistent memory.
4. Modular structure allows the system to adapt to evolving research, development, and prompt engineering needs.

**Use Cases:**
- Solo researcher or developer seeking reliable LLM memory.
- Prompt engineers iterating on instructions and behavioral strategies.
- Anyone needing a practical, sustainable workaround for LLM statelessness using Copilot + GitHub.
