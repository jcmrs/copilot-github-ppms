## Instructions

1. Review the transcript (note: only partial context is available, full restoration not possible).
2. Study the lesson on persistent memory transcript requirements.
3. Follow the protocol for system handoffs.
4. Reference supporting materials (guardrails, research, templates, backlog) as needed.

## Lessons Learned

- Always capture complete verbatim transcripts for persistent system memory. Partial transcripts risk context loss.
- Document protocol and milestones using agreed conventions for discoverability and clarity.
