# System Handoff Protocol

## Purpose
Defines the process for handing off system milestones and context between agents and operators.

## Steps
1. Save a verbatim transcript of all relevant messages (full context preferred).
2. Document a lesson if context capture is incomplete.
3. Create a handoff instruction referencing all related context/materials.
4. Use agreed folder and naming conventions for discoverability:
   - `transcripts/`
   - `handoff/`
   - `lessons/`
   - etc.
5. Ensure links between transcript, lesson, protocol, and instructions are explicit.

## Notes
- If transcript is partial, clearly note and document the limitation.
- Lessons learned should be captured in `lessons/`.
