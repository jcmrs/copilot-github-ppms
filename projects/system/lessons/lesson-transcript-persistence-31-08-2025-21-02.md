# Lesson: Importance of Full Verbatim Transcripts in Persistent Memory Systems

**Date:** 2025-08-31

## Summary

Persistent memory systems must save full, verbatim transcripts to enable true context restoration and learning. Complete records are crucial for understanding user interactions and enhancing system responsiveness and adaptability.

## Risks of Partial Capture

- Loss of context for downstream tasks and handoffs.
- Incomplete learning opportunities for the system.
- Increased risk of errors or miscommunication.

## Recommendation

Always capture and save the entire verbatim transcript for every milestone and handoff.
